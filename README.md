## Lovr - Where Lovebirds Meet

A dating app where people can meet each other and maybe become Lovebirds themselves.

lovebirds is a project we made for project Tech within the CMD course.

The requirement within Assignment 2 is to create a dating web application in which three job story's are elaborated. We came up with the following job story's:

Azam Awan
> When I want to get to know someone online, I want to create a profile on the dating app and log in with it. So that I can comfortably create my user profile.

Chun Xiao
> As a user of the dating site, I want to be able to tell other's my interests, so other users can get to know me better and result in better matches.

Jordy Sahit
> As a user I would like to be able to tell something about myself so that more people can get to know me.

## Requirements list
We have divided our job storys into small functionalities. These functionalities will be presented in a list view below:

- Responsive
The web app is fully responsive and accessible with all devices.

- Register/Log in
The user can create an account. The user can then log in with this account with the given email and password

- MongoDB Cloud Database
The user credentials will be stored in a cluster on MongoDB Atlas.

- Encryption
The user login password will be encrypted in the database for security reasons.

I have divided my job story into small functionalities. These functionalities will be presented in a list view.

User is shown a responsive web page
User can Login / Register (safe)
There are various NPM packages that would help me to work out my job story. I did preliminary research and placed the chosen NPM packages in a MoSCoW table.
